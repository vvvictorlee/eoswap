Wrapping/unwrapping FTM
For reasons that have to do with maintaining compatibility with Ethereum, FTM must be “wrapped” to be used on Artion. The Artion Wrapping Station exchanges your FTM for wFTM on a 1:1 basis.
To quickly wrap FTM into wFTM:
Click on the account button on the upper right of the screen, and select FTM/WFTM Station
Specify the amount of FTM that you’d like to wrap. There is a small transaction fee for the conversion.
To unwrap wFTM back to FTM, click on the double arrow to reverse the wrap direction, indicating that you are unwrapping wFTM back into FTM.

Note importantly that to wrap and unwrap you’ll need to keep a small amount of FTM to cover transaction fees.
