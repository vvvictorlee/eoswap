Collection
What is a Collection?
A collection is an  or  Smart Contract deployed on the Opera network. All the NFTs from the same Smart Contract are of the same collection.
How to register a new collection?
A  is the process of adding your existing NFT Smart Contract to our Artion platform.
Once submitted your collection with required information, our team will carefully review the validity of the collection. Either approved or rejected, you will get an email with an approval or rejection message. Once approved, your collection will appear in the collections list with a verification badge.
Benefits of registering a collection?
You will not be asked to approve individual NFTs from collections created in our platform. You may set a royalty for NFTs minted under our main Artion collection and collections created in our platform. 
Who can register a collection on Artion?
Any collection owner can register their collection on Artion.
What are categories?
A category is a set of NFTs, which share the same characteristics depending on their NFT Smart Contracts. When you register a collection in Artion, you can select upto 3 categories. When a collection is registered with a certain number of categories selected, all the NFTs from this collection will share those categories.
Categories are only defined in our Artion platform, other marketplaces might have totally different groups of categories. Once categories are selected for a collection, all the NFTs from the collection share those selected categories which will help users find out NFTs easily and quickly in our explore page.
What is royalty and how does it work?
A royalty is a percentage figure ranging within 0% to 100%. This can be set at the time of NFT mint. Once set higher than 0%, creators of NFT will earn royalties for each time NFT is sold in Artion. So, if royalty is set to 5% for your NFT, you will get 5% of NFTâ€™s sale price every time your NFT is sold in Artion.
Q&A
Can people buy / sell collections?
Collections cannot be sold or purchased. Collection might seem to be a group of nfts, but technically, it is a smart contract with which users can mint NFTs.
Will the category value be modified after set?
No
Can I create a new collection of your own?
No, it is not available at the moment. Creation is the process of deploying and registering your own NFT smart contract using Artion GUI (without much knowledge about Smart Contracts and NFT).
