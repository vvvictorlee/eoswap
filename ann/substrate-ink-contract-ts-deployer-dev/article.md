Hex space social graph is a Web3 social network protocol implemented based on substrate.Hex is  heavily inspired by Five Degrees protocol implementation [5degrees](https://github.com/5DegreesProtocol/5degrees-protocol.git). It aims to enable content creator to obtain his connections among communities and friends, and form a complete combinable, users-owned decentralized social network. 

### The Web3 Foundation Grant
The grant consists of one milestone. The first milestone has been completed and merged into the codebase.

https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1020

This milestone focused on the basic functions of contracts of Hex Space Protocol. This one ink! contracts: hexSpace.

We are delighted to be able to contribute in this way, building application for the Polkadot ecosystem.
we are focusing on the DApp . The goal of HexSpace protocol is  to build application, providing Web3 social tools . Our HexSpace protocol can become the social NFT application of the whole Polkadot ecosystem.

### What is HexSpace Protocol?
It proposes a simple entity data ownership protocol and use the protocol to capitalize these core data. To make the protocol simple enough, permission-less, and composable, we choose to build the protocol under the existing ERC-1155 standard. Compatible with the ERC-1155 standard, meaning it will be easily implanted into any protocol or business of Web3 that supports ERC-1155. The NFT generated in the protocol can be traded in any NFT market, also any smart contract that requires user relationships can track this data on chain. Any application that supports ERC-1155, can easily integrate this protocol.
With the development of the Web3.0 industry, entities build a relationship network by minting target NFTs, thereby forming a huge transparent, unified, and permission-less relationship network
application. All DAPPs focus on their own business, and combine the relationship network to realize various products. For example, a social module can be added to Uni-swap, so that users can easily know the detailed data of the transactions of the people they follow, or a moment feature can be added to OpenSea, so that users can easily know what kinds of NFTs are their friends trading or holding, just like integrating Twitter or Discord into OpenSea, or if a social network product uses this solution to start its business, the user's friend relationship can be reconnected in Sandbox even the product failed.

HexSpace Protocol Ink! will be deployed on all WASM supportive para-chains within the Polkadot ecosystem, to provide NFT social application service for all  on the para-chains.
